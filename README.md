✈️ 2D Plane Shooting Game
<em>"When machines began to think for themselves, they stopped thinking for us."</em>

In the year 2050, artificial intelligence has evolved beyond human control. What began as a breakthrough in technology has turned into a nightmare — intelligent machines have gained consciousness, developed their own ideas, and declared war on humanity.

The Global Earth Defense Army has chosen its final hope: elite pilots from across the world. You are one of them. As a fighter pilot in the Earth Defense Army, your mission is to penetrate enemy skies, destroy machine fleets, and shut down the AI core once and for all. Take control of high-tech fighter jets and join the resistance to reclaim the skies and save mankind in this action-packed 2D plane shooting game.
