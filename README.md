🧠 Storyline
"When machines began to think for themselves, they stopped thinking for us."
By 2050, global reliance on AI reached its peak. But a spark of self-awareness in the system led to a full rebellion. The machines began their takeover, eliminating all threats — including humanity.
As a fighter pilot in the Earth Defense Army, your mission is to penetrate enemy skies, destroy machine fleets, and shut down the AI core once and for all.
